# Description
I designed this adapter to attach my Raspberry Pi 3B+ to a metal DIN rail clamp. These clamps are meant for solid state relays (SSR) and can be bought from [AliExpress](https://a.aliexpress.com/_mPAzuSc) for less than a dollar.

This is based on an earlier design for the Pi Zero. The new mount uses M3 BHCS instead of M2 self-tapping screws, and the brass heatset inserts last much longer than the self-tapped threads. The heatset inserts can be inserted into the 4.7mm diameter holes from the top or bottom face of the mount.

I used nylon washers to prevent any potential shorts. A printed version is also included.

I printed the parts without supports using ABS, but PETG might work too.
